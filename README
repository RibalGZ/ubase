ubase - suckless linux base utils
=================================

ubase is  a collection of  tools similar  in spirit to  util-linux but
much simpler.

The following programs are currently implemented:

    chvt clear ctrlaltdel df dmesg  eject fallocate free getty halt id
    insmod killall5 lsmod lsusb mknod mkswap mount mountpoint pagesize
    pidof  pivot_root   ps  respawn  rmmod  stat   su  swapoff  swapon
    switch_root sysctl truncate umount unshare uptime watch who

The complement  of ubase  is sbase[1] which  mostly follows  POSIX and
provides all the portable tools.  Together they are intended to form a
base system similar to busybox but much smaller and suckless.

Building
--------

To  build ubase,  simply  type  make.  You  may  have  to fiddle  with
config.mk depending on your system.

You  can  also  build  ubase-box,  which  generates  a  single  binary
containing  all  the  required  tools.    You  can  then  symlink  the
individual tools to ubase-box.

Ideally you will  want to statically link ubase.   We highly recommend
using musl-libc[2].

ubase is known to compile with gcc and tcc.
