.TH CTRLALTDEL 8 ubase-VERSION
.SH NAME
\fBctrlaltdel\fR - set the function of Ctrl-Alt-Del combination
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBctrlaltdel\fR [\fB-hs\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Based  on  examination of the linux/kernel/sys.c code, it is clear that
there are two supported functions that the  Ctrl-Alt-Del  sequence  can
perform:  a  hard reset, which immediately reboots the computer without
calling sync(2) and without any other preparation; and  a  soft  reset,
which  sends the SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the init process (this is
always the process with PID 1).  If this option is  used,  the  init(8)
program must support this feature.
